    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        My name is igbinidu Jeremiah [my Alt-school student ID ALT/SOE/023/1550] I'm from Edo state Benin city precisely.. my life journey is such a beautiful one
        and I believe it might inspire others.. I study at university of Benin with B.A history.. I joined the journey
        of alt school through the awareness of my twin brother friend while he was a student then, he told me about alt
        school and at first I was wondering if it's something I can easily understand since I'm not a science student,
        but he definitely gave me courage, that I can learn programming. it's not for science student alone,anyone can
        do it. That's when I gained courage of learning programming i`m so delighted
        to be part of this present cohort..
